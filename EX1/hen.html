        <li><strong>Feathering:</strong> Hens have feathers that can vary in color and pattern. The color of the feathers often depends on the breed.</li>
        <li><strong>Beak and Comb:</strong> Hens have beaks for pecking at food, and many also have a comb on top of their heads, which helps regulate body temperature.</li>
        <li><strong>Claws and Talons:</strong> Hens have claws or talons on their feet for scratching the ground in search of food.</li>
        <li><strong>Brooding Behavior:</strong> Some hens exhibit brooding behavior, where they sit on eggs to incubate and hatch chicks.</li>
        <li><strong>Foraging Instinct:</strong> Hens have a natural instinct to forage for insects, seeds, and small plants.</li>
        <li><strong>Social Animals:</strong> Chickens are social animals and often form flocks. They communicate with each other using various vocalizations.</li>
